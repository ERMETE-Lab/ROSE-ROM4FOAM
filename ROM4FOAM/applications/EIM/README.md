# Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM)

This folder collects the codes for the [Empirical Interpolation Method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631073X04004248) (EIM) for OpenFOAM, applied to scalar and vector fields only, divided into the typical Offline and Online phase.

The extension to vector fields has been published in [Silva et al. (2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nme.6679).

In each folder there is a file with the instructions on how to use each solver.
