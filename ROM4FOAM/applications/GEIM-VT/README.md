# Generalized Empirical Interpolation Method - Vectorial Treatment (GEIM-VT)

This folder collects the codes for the Generalized Empirical Interpolation Method - Vectorial Treatment (GEIM-VT) for OpenFOAM, applied to scalar fields only, divided into the typical Offline and Online phase.

During the Online Phase, random noise can be introduced as an option of the solver, moreover regularization is implemented using TR-GEIM.

In each folder there is a file with the instructions on how to use each solver.
